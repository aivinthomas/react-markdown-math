## What is this?

This package is a [React][] component that can be given a string of markdown with math (in Latex format)
that itâ€™ll safely render to React elements.
You can pass plugins to change how markdown is transformed to React elements and
pass components that will be used instead of normal HTML elements.

*   to learn math using Latex, see [this][latex]
## When should I use this?

You might need to render complex mathematical equations written in Markdown for your React application. This library uses [React Markdown][react-markdown] and [Better React Mathjax][better-react-mathjax] under the hood. You can use this for a quick implementation.

## Install

```sh
npm install react-markdown-math
```
## Use

```sh
<ReactMarkdownMath markdown='\\(\\frac{10}{4x} \\approx 2^{12}\\)' />
```

## API

The default export is `ReactMarkdown`.

### `markdown`

The markdown string
### `reactMarkdownProps`

This optional prop is for additional configuration of React Markdown. Find the details [here][react-markdown-props]
